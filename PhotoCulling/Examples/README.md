# SwiftUI Code Examples

This directory contains example code and patterns used in PhotoCulling.

## Files

- **BindingUsageExample.swift** - Comprehensive examples showing how to work with `@Binding` in SwiftUI, specifically for the `FolderSource?` type used throughout the application.

## Purpose

These examples demonstrate best practices for:
- Reading and writing binding values
- Passing bindings to child views
- Observing changes in bindings
- Working with optional bindings safely

## Usage

The code in this directory is intended for reference and learning. It extends existing types (like `CopyTasksView`) to show different patterns in context.

For the main guide, see the root-level `BINDING_USAGE_GUIDE.md` file.
